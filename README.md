# SSUP

**SSUP** is a method for entity-page discovery. Given an entity-page of a website, **SSUP** finds the set of entity-pages in the website. For example, given the page describing Fernando Alonso in the Formula 1 official website, **SSUP** finds the pages that describe the drivers in this website.
